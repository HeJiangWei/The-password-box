### Notes

Deko is an app for iPhone and iPad for creating beautiful, unique wallpapers. This is the open source release. It is essentially the exact same app that is live on the App Store currently, but with all HockeyApp / Localytics / IAP stuff removed or commented out. The license is permissive, but I nevertheless ask that you don't just upload a carbon copy of Deko to the App Store. The initial release was in January 2013, and was written in a hurry. This is definitely apparent from the code, which is a bit of a mess.

The purpose of this release is twofold: a) I like releasing sources for my stuff, and b) it'd be cool if people extended the features of Deko. Feature ideas are e.g. a Mac version, print-quality export, more scene configurations, etc. If someone adds stuff to this version, I'd be happy to integrate it into the App Store version and add a credit to the credits view.

Deko was conceived and realised by [Jaakko Tuomivaara](http://jaakko.co.uk) and [Johan Halin](http://jukeboxbabe.com), published by [Aero Deko](http://aerodeko.com) with support from DigiDemo / AVEK, OKM.

### App Store Description

Create your own beautiful abstract images, patterns and wallpapers with a simple swipe of your finger. Deko allows you to build galleries, save new wallpapers and share your stunning and unique designs with friends. 

The possibilities are endless as each pattern is always different. The interactive image creation allows you to subtly shift a pattern's shapes or colors with a light swipe, or to create a fresh design with a full swipe gesture.

With Deko you can:
• Create your own beautiful patterns
• Save wallpapers and home screens
• Export your patterns to tweak further in other apps
• Share with friends
• Be inspired

Make your screen beautiful with Deko.
